# Schema Difference Counting Fix

## Issue Description

The schema comparison feature had a bug where the summary was incorrectly counting differences:

- **Problem**: When comparing schemas, the summary showed `type_differences: 1` even when there were actually 6 or more type differences across columns.
- **Root Cause**: The counting logic was counting the number of *tables* with differences, not the actual number of individual differences.

## Example of the Issue

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_differences": 1,
    "type_differences": 1,  // ❌ Wrong: counting tables, not differences
    "column_differences": 1
  },
  "diff": {
    "type_diffs": {
      "invoices": [
        {"column": "id", "source_type": "integer", "target_type": "INT"},
        {"column": "payment", "source_type": "money", "target_type": "DECIMAL(19,2)"},
        {"column": "date_received", "source_type": "timestamp", "target_type": "TIMESTAMP_LTZ"},
        // ... 3 more differences
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_differences": 27,
    "type_differences": 22,  // ✅ Correct: counting all type differences
    "column_differences": 0,
    "table_differences": 5
  },
  "diff": {
    "type_diffs": {
      "invoices": [
        // 6 type differences
      ],
      "accounts": [
        // 16 type differences
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Type Difference Counting

**Before**: `len(diff_result.get("type_diffs", {}))`
- This counted the number of tables that had type differences

**After**: 
```python
type_differences_count = 0
for table_type_diffs in type_diffs_dict.values():
    type_differences_count += len(table_type_diffs)
```
- This counts all individual type differences across all tables

### 2. Column Difference Counting

**Before**: `len(diff_result.get("column_diffs", {}))`
- This counted the number of tables that had column differences

**After**:
```python
column_differences_count = 0
for table_col_diffs in column_diffs_dict.values():
    column_differences_count += len(table_col_diffs.get("columns_only_in_source", []))
    column_differences_count += len(table_col_diffs.get("columns_only_in_target", []))
```
- This counts all individual column differences across all tables

### 3. Total Difference Calculation

The total differences now accurately reflects the sum of:
- Table differences (tables only in source + tables only in target)
- Individual column differences across all tables
- Individual type differences across all tables

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. Users get accurate counts of differences in the summary
2. The summary properly reflects the granularity of changes
3. Total differences accurately represents all individual differences found

## Testing

Two test scripts were created to verify the fix:
- `test_type_diff_counting.py`: Specifically tests type difference counting
- `test_comprehensive_diff_counting.py`: Tests all types of difference counting

Both tests pass successfully with the fixed code.
