Sqeleton
---------

**Sqeleton** is a Python library for querying SQL databases.

It consists of -

- A fast and concise query builder, inspired by PyPika and SQLAlchemy

- A modular database interface, with drivers for a long list of SQL databases.

It is comparable to other libraries such as SQLAlchemy or PyPika, in terms of API and intended audience. However there are several notable ways in which it is different.
